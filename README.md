### Updated projects
#### Facebook messenger
**Before you ever advance and continue reading about this project, keep in mind that I hold no responsibilty if you're account get banned**
I am happily eased to tell you that the facebook messenger project in python (aka Messenger in GUI) has finally returned to work, it can **send** messages again :D
It can send messages to anyone you want but ,of course, if it's your friend, and if you have special day for example the independence day, you'd actually want to send 'Happy independence day' to all your friends, then don't worry about that 'cause you can send them all in one click.(This function was remade specifically to not get detected by the FB security system)

***Thanks for reading this, Bye :D***
