# To do android
This app is pretty much helpful for people who have appointment and can't afforf to forget them :)
##Features
###Theme Management
You can choose variaty of themes and it will apply and never change to its default color until you do so!
###Notification mechanism
YOu get notified whenever a task is due.
###Profile & Save data
Even when you uninstall the app, your data is not erased since it is being stored in json file!
###Multi-language
You can use the application using English or Fran√ßais
##What went down?
The **Notification mechanism** does't work properly as we exit the app because the app uses while loop to check whether the time of task is up or no.
##Project ambitions
Almost all I wanted to achieve using this project has come true, however I actually want to see it run in the background, have it less laggy and remove the kivy loading screen
