# Pytranslate
This app helps in times where you need to understand someone but don't know how to speak their language.
## Features
### API
The API I used was unofficial google translator api "googletrans". I used it before I knew there were better options than an **unofficial** api
## What went down?
Since this project uses an unofficial api, it may get the user ip banned from google services, so **I extremly warn others from using this very frequently** 
## Project ambitions
I wanted to implement a voice recognition and speaker mechanisms where we can communicate with others who may not know how to read or write!
