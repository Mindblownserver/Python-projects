# Password Generator
## Description 
Passwords are very **vital** in our life, they keep our private informations away from the public eye, however creating a strong one is a hard, let alone memorizing it.
That is why we need a program that organizes our passwords and create one so good that it will prevent cyber-attack. The **Password generator** generates password by encrypting a given word(s) via a neat algorithm.
The project is still in its early stages as it lacks some managemenet.
## Status
Ongoing. There's more coming to the file than meets the eye.
## Ambitions
I'm willing to add as much features to it in order for the program to execute efficiently and accurately. I plan on improving the encryption algorithm in the near future, maybe in two to three days.
In addition, I want my app to save passwords in a file which can be previewed in an organized section in the same app
